abstract="Voucher specimens ensure that the identity of organisms studied in the field or in laboratory experiments can be verified, and ensure that new species concepts can be applied to past research. Guidelines on the collection, preparation, and deposition of voucher specimens and means of referral to them are given. Type specimens and the nomenclature of species names are briefly described.",
